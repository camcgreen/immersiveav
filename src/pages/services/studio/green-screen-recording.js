              Green screen recording allows presenters to be filmed in a studio
              space, with the background replaced with virtual content.
            </h2>
            <p>
              Imagine your virtual event, hosted by a presenter immersed in a
              virtual environment, with unparalleled levels of interactivity.
              The green screen filming technique brings Hollywood special
              effects to corporate events and makes anything possible.

              An ideal option for conferences and events, our green screen
              filming studios are a full-service solution guaranteed to get you
              noticed. Staffed by an experienced team of experts, who will never
              let you down.
            </p>
            <p>
              The green screen studio is lit with studio lighting, balanced with
              a digital light meter to achieve equal luminosity of the colour
              green throughout the set. We use media servers such as Disguise to
              replace the green areas with virtual content.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src={SuppImage2}

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              The environment we add in can be virtually anything. We can
              augment the green areas with virtual content created in generative
              content engines such as Notch or Unreal Engine.
