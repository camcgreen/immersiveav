              Everyone loves to have fun and be challenged. Custom games feature
              both these attractions and can be customised to your brand and
              services. The scope of gamification presents us with a completely
              blank canvas. We can create whatever you need.

              A perfect fit for live and virtual events, some ideas include
              touchscreen games, VR games, gesture controlled games and
              gamification which combines physical actions with a digital
              experience. Such as the rope pull challenge we created for Land
              Rover.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the key features of all gamification experiences is the
              leaderboard. You invite people to play your game, they exchange
              their details for a position on the leaderboard, often with the
              incentive of prizes for the top performers. This allows you to
              keep people in your space for longer, and collect their details
              for future follow up.
