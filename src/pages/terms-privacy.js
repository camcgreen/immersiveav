              the contractual delivery date incurs a 100% penalty of the total
              Rental Charges and the Hirer agrees that the charges contained at
              clauses 9.3.1 to 9.3.3 (inclusive) are a genuine pre-estimate of
              the loss that Immersive AV would suffer in the event of
              cancellation by the Hirer. 9.4. In the event the Hirer wishes to
              terminate the Contract during the Hire Term, prior to the last day
              of the Hire Term, Immersive AV reserves the right to enforce a

              annum for accelerated payment, calculated from the date of payment
