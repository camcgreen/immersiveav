Discussing the appointments, founder and CEO of Immersive AV commented: *“As the events industry evolves to the return of in-person events, the appointment of Russell and Neil underlines the commitment to strengthen our team, providing our valued clients with innovative technical solutions and unparalleled customer service they can rely on.”*

*“The appointment of Russell and Neil adds an additional dimension to our client services team.

When asked about joining the Immersive AV team, Russell said: *“I am thrilled to be a part of the new look team.

I come from a technical background, I’m passionate about helping clients achieve their objectives through creative technical solutions, which pull from all areas of my expertise. It’s been a bumpy ride for everyone in the industry, but the level of innovation at Immersive AV and across the industry excites me and I cannot wait to overcome the challenges ahead and deliver memorable experiences for Immersive AV and our clients.”*

Sharon added: *“The past year has been tough for us all. I’d like to say how personally sad I am from having to lose some wonderful colleagues along the way. But as things open back up, it’s time to look to the future and focus our energy on how we can support each other’s recovery.”*
