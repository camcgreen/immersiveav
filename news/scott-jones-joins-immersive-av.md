Immersive AV would like to extend the warmest of welcomes to our newest member of the team, Account Director Scott Jones.

Scott joins the [Immersive AV](../../services/live) family with a wealth of experience, providing leading-edge event technology solutions for numerous outstanding suppliers. Scott’s passion is for creating memorable experiences which transcend the preconceived boundaries between physical and digital technologies—be it for live, virtual or hybrid events.

Discussing his new role, Scott said: *“The prospect of working for Immersive AV was an opportunity too good to turn down. Having worked in the events industry for 17 years in various technical and sales roles, I feel I have a lot to offer to the Immersive AV team. I’ve worked on many large scale projects for agencies at events around the world, which give me inspiration and ideas for future Immersive AV projects. I’m fascinated by the juxtaposition of tangible and digital technology and how we integrate the two to evoke emotions and influence people’s decisions.”*

Immersive AV CEO, Sharon Reynolds said: *“As the events industry rapidly swung from dormant to dominant over the past few months, we’ve been able to continually expand and strengthen our team at Immersive AV—enabling us to provide our clients with an exceptional experience every time. Scott’s appointment is key to that process. His vision, technical understanding and exceptional interpersonal skills mean he’ll be a vital cog in the process of helping the agencies we work with to create arresting events which exceed expectations.”*

*“Scott will join Russell Young as one of our Account Directors who look after our agency clients for live events and activations. To meet Scott, is to love Scott. He’s just a lovely young man who really knows his stuff, every conversation we’ve had has been wonderful. I’m delighted Scott has joined the team and I’m excited to introduce him to our clients.”*

Scott added: *“My first day for Immersive AV was at Event Tech Live last week, and what an introduction that was! I was blown away by the creative innovation on the stand and delighted by the reception from visitors. I’m thrilled by the opportunity to work at the cutting edge of event technology innovation and help our clients create amazing events!”*
