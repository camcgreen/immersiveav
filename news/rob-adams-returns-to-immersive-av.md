Saying hello to an old friend after a brief period apart, is always a great feeling—and that’s what we’ve done with Rob Adams!

As we continue to strengthen the team at Immersive AV, we’re excited to welcome Rob back to the business as Operations Manager.

Prior to the pandemic, Rob spent nine years at Immersive AV and ITR, fulfilling a range of positions in technical and sales related roles. Rob’s passion for technology and intricate understanding of what it takes to exceed a client’s expectations will be a tremendous asset with him onboard our new look team.

Discussing his new role, Rob said: *“I am absolutely over the moon about coming back. I love this company and the owners, Sharon and Steve. I was here during the initial stages of the pandemic, helping to secure new business and support our existing clients through a very difficult period. Leaving was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do, but ultimately I didn’t want to be a burden on the business by claiming a salary whilst the industry was bleeding.”*

*“I’ve been away from Immersive AV for eight months, whilst the company rebuilt itself, and I’m honoured to return as the Operations Manager. I am passionate about driving the business forward, with the focus being on the customer’s experience and expectations. Nothing was too much for us before, and nor will it be now. We’ll always go above and beyond for our clients.”*

Immersive AV CEO, Sharon Reynolds: *“I’m delighted to welcome Rob back to the Immersive AV family. We had to make some really difficult decisions over the past eighteen months, letting some truly wonderful people go. But we always said that when the industry picks up again our doors will be open for them, and it’s great to be able to stick to that promise. Rob’s an Immersive AV guy through and through, his personality and approach to work reflects the ethos of our business perfectly. Rob is popular with both staff and clients, his passion and dedication will help to ensure we always go above and beyond. On behalf of myself, Steve and the whole team at Immersive AV, I’d like to say welcome back Rob, and thank you for working with us again.”*

Rob’s new role will involve overseeing all operations of Immersive AV, as well as developing new areas within the business, through which we can offer an even better quality of service for our clients. Rob can be contacted via email on [rob.adams@immersiveav.com](mailto:rob.adams@immersiveav.com) or through his [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-adams-30154347/).
