## Discover the latest developments in experiential technology

Immersive AV are excited to exhibit at this year’s [Event Tech Live 2021, taking place physically ](https://eventtechlive.com/london/) 3-4 November at the Old Truman Brewery in London, and virtually 1-5 November through our 3D virtual event experience.

Whatever your requirements for creative technology at live, [virtual](https://immersiveav.com/event-technical-production/virtual-event-production-services/) or [hybrid events](https://immersiveav.com/event-technical-production/hybrid-event-technical-production-services/), we have a portfolio of solutions to help you attract attention, maximise engagement and achieve a greater event marketing success than ever before.

Who could forget the generative rain and umbrella experience from Event Tech Live 2019? Our installation was the talk of the show, generating a lot of interest and shares on social media. You’ll be pleased to hear the umbrella returns in 2021, with new levels of interactivity and a host of other engaging attractions, including an oversized gamification experience (sshhh, don’t tell anyone).

We’d be delighted to welcome you to our space on stand 1106 at Event Tech Live, to discuss how our suite of creative technology experiences can help you achieve your event marketing objectives.

For those attending virtually, we’ve updated our virtual experience centre which showcases some of our best work—all set within a 3D virtual representation of the Old Truman Brewery. Our team will be available during the day to discuss your requirements and guide you through our range of services.

We’ll keep you updated with developments for the live exhibition and how to access our virtual experience centre. We look forward to welcoming you at either the live or virtual events.
